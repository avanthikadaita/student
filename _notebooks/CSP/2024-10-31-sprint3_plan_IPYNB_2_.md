## Final Intro

Teacher and peer evaluation are critical to our success and improvements.

Be sure to support each meeting's objectives by performing self-reviews, providing feedback to peers, and acting on the feedback received from teachers and peers. The best way to support dialogue in our environment is to provide a Review Ticket (GitHub Issues and/or GitHub Pages Utterance).

1. **Individual Issues**:
   - It is required to build an issue and/or blog that describes your personal journey in all sprints.
   - By the end of this period, you should have personal issues/blogs related to Sprint 1, Sprint 2, and Sprint 3.

2. **Team Issue(s)**:
   - To collaborate effectively, there should be issue(s) assigned to you from the team.
   - These issues should show progression from ideation, development, integration (pull request), and how you validated tests.

3. **Preparation**:
   - It is best to go through checklists, but be aware these are guidelines.
   - The teacher will want you to summarize information effectively.
   - A significant part of your success will depend on how you present and self-evaluate.

### Final Evaluation

This section outlines the criteria and guidelines for the final evaluation of your trimester work. The evaluation is divided into two main categories: Assignments and Skills. Each category has specific items that will be graded based on the provided guidelines.

#### Grading Guideline
- **55%**: Minimum per item
- **75%**: Mostly done
- **85%**: Complete
- **90%**: Maximum perfection
